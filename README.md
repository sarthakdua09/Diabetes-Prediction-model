🧠 Diabetes Prediction Model
🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict whether an individual is diabetic or not, based on a set of health-related parameters. It leverages Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and classification modeling.

📌 Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions globally. Early prediction and timely treatment can help manage the disease effectively. The objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model using supervised machine learning techniques on the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.
